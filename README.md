# 17995-analytics-api-sample-destinations-report
In this sample, you will learn how to generate two analytics reports: 1) a listing of all the URLs where your videos have been viewed, with the number of views for each URL; 2) a listing of all your players where videos have been viewed, along with the domain the player resides on and the video views.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience:

<table>
	<thead>
		<th>File</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td>index.html</td>
		<td>The sample as working HTML page</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>css/styles.css</td>
		<td>CSS used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>js/index.js</td>
		<td>JavaScript used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
</table>
